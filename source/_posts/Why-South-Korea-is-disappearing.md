Every two years one million Japanese disappear. China's population will halve by the end of the century, the median age in Italy has reached 48. All around the world birth rates are crashing - Is humanity dying out? What is going on and how bad is it?

For hundreds of thousands of years the human population barely grew at all, haunted by disease, famine and war until the industrial revolution - exponential progress led to exponential growth, pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the year 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later. And our numbers will continue to rise for at least another 60 years. 

But this growth obscures something: People kinda stopped having babies. For a stable populations, every couple needs to have two children on average. If the number is higher it grows, if lower, it shrinks. If it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly: Like in South Korea, one of the hottest exporters of pop culture. Its fertility rate lay at 0.8 children per woman in 2022, the lowest in the world. This means 100 South Koreans of child bearing age today will have 40 kids, who then will have 16 kids, who then will have 6.
